    <!-- Cache Memory -->
    <h2>39. What is cache memory and how does it increase computer performance?</h2>
    <p>Cache memory is a small, high-speed storage area located between the CPU and RAM. It stores frequently used data to reduce the time it takes for the CPU to access data from the slower main memory.</p>
    <p><strong>How cache memory increases performance:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Faster data access: Frequently used data is quickly retrieved from the cache rather than RAM.</li>
        <li>Reduces CPU wait time: Minimizes the time spent by the CPU waiting for data, improving overall system performance.</li>

    <!-- Number Systems -->
    <h2>1. What is a number system? What are the types of number systems used in a computer?</h2>
    <p>A number system is a writing system for expressing numbers; it is a mathematical notation for representing numbers in a consistent manner. In a number system, a set of digits or symbols are used to represent values.</p>
    <p><strong>Types of number systems used in computers:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Binary Number System (Base 2):</strong> Uses two digits, 0 and 1. It is the fundamental number system used by computers because of their digital nature.</li>
        <li><strong>Decimal Number System (Base 10):</strong> Uses ten digits, 0 to 9. It is the system humans use in everyday life.</li>
        <li><strong>Octal Number System (Base 8):</strong> Uses digits 0 to 7. It is sometimes used in computing as a shorthand for binary.</li>
        <li><strong>Hexadecimal Number System (Base 16):</strong> Uses digits 0 to 9 and letters A to F. It is often used in programming and computer science as a more compact way of representing binary numbers.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Positional vs Non-Positional Number Systems -->
    <h2>2. What is the difference between positional and non-positional number systems?</h2>
    <p><strong>Positional Number System:</strong> In this system, the value of a digit depends on its position in the number. For example, in the decimal system, the number 345 is interpreted as 3×10² + 4×10¹ + 5×10⁰.</p>
    <p><strong>Non-Positional Number System:</strong> The value of each digit is independent of its position. An example is the Roman numeral system, where "IV" represents 4, regardless of the order of the symbols.</p>

    <p><strong>Applications of Boolean Algebra:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Digital Circuit Design: Used to design circuits like adders, multiplexers, and flip-flops.</li>

    <p><strong>The three basic Boolean operators are:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AND (∧):</strong> The result is true only if both inputs are true.</li>
        <li><strong>OR (∨):</strong> The result is true if at least one input is true.</li>
        <li><strong>NOT (¬):</strong> Inverts the value. If A is true (1), it becomes false (0), and vice versa.</li>

    </ul>

    <!-- Programming Languages -->
    <h2>2. What is a programming language? What are its types with merits and demerits?</h2>
    <p>A Programming Language is a formal language consisting of instructions used to produce a wide range of outputs, such as software, scripts, or algorithms.</p>
    <p><strong>Types of Programming Languages:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Low-Level Languages:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Assembly language.</li>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong> C, C++.</p>
    <p><strong>Interpreter:</strong> An interpreter translates the program line by line into machine code during execution. Errors are detected at runtime.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Python, JavaScript.</p>
    <p><strong>Difference:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Compiler produces an independent executable file, while the interpreter directly executes the source code.</li>

    </ul>

    <!-- Syntax vs Semantics Error -->
    <h2>5. What is the difference between syntax error and semantics error?</h2>
    <p><strong>Syntax Error:</strong> A syntax error occurs when the code does not follow the grammatical rules of the programming language.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Missing parentheses in a function call.</p>
    <p><strong>Semantics Error:</strong> A semantics error occurs when the program's logic is incorrect, even though the syntax is correct.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Using the wrong formula for calculating an average.</p>

    <!-- Algorithm and Flowchart -->
    <h2>6. What is an algorithm? What is a flowchart? Give examples.</h2>

    </ul>

    <!-- Looping -->
    <h2>10. What is looping in programming? What is the difference between while and do-while loops?</h2>
    <p><strong>Looping:</strong> Looping is a control structure that repeats a set of instructions multiple times.</p>
