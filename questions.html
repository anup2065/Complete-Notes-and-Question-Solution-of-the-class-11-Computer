        <!-- Number Systems -->
        <h2>1. What is a number system? What are the types of number systems used in a computer?</h2>
        <p>A number system is a writing system for expressing numbers; it is a mathematical notation for representing numbers in a consistent manner. In a number system, a set of digits or symbols are used to represent values.</p>
        <p><strong>Types of number systems used in computers:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Binary Number System (Base 2):</strong> Uses two digits, 0 and 1. It is the fundamental number system used by computers because of their digital nature.</li>
            <li><strong>Decimal Number System (Base 10):</strong> Uses ten digits, 0 to 9. It is the system humans use in everyday life.</li>
            <li><strong>Octal Number System (Base 8):</strong> Uses digits 0 to 7. It is sometimes used in computing as a shorthand for binary.</li>
            <li><strong>Hexadecimal Number System (Base 16):</strong> Uses digits 0 to 9 and letters A to F. It is often used in programming and computer science as a more compact way of representing binary numbers.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <!-- Positional vs Non-Positional Number Systems -->
        <h2>2. What is the difference between positional and non-positional number systems?</h2>
        <p><strong>Positional Number System:</strong> In this system, the value of a digit depends on its position in the number. For example, in the decimal system, the number 345 is interpreted as 3×10² + 4×10¹ + 5×10⁰.</p>
        <p><strong>Non-Positional Number System:</strong> The value of each digit is independent of its position. An example is the Roman numeral system, where "IV" represents 4, regardless of the order of the symbols.</p>
    
        <!-- Boolean Algebra -->
        <h2>3. What is Boolean algebra? Give its applications.</h2>
        <p>Boolean Algebra is a branch of algebra that deals with variables that can only take one of two values: true (1) or false (0). It is used to simplify and analyze logical expressions, especially in the design of digital circuits.</p>
        <p><strong>Applications of Boolean Algebra:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Digital Circuit Design: Used to design circuits like adders, multiplexers, and flip-flops.</li>
            <li>Computer Programming: Helps in decision-making processes and control flow.</li>
            <li>Search Engines: Boolean algebra is used in query processing to filter relevant search results.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <!-- Boolean Logic -->
        <h2>4. What is Boolean logic? Explain the three Boolean operators with the help of truth tables.</h2>
        <p>Boolean Logic is a form of algebra in which variables take on values of 1 or 0 (true or false), and logic operations are performed based on these values.</p>
        <p><strong>The three basic Boolean operators are:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AND (∧):</strong> The result is true only if both inputs are true.</li>
            <li><strong>OR (∨):</strong> The result is true if at least one input is true.</li>
            <li><strong>NOT (¬):</strong> Inverts the value. If A is true (1), it becomes false (0), and vice versa.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><strong>Software:</strong> Software is a collection of programs, data, and documentation that performs a set of related tasks (e.g., Microsoft Office, which includes Word, Excel, etc.).</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Programming Languages -->
    <h2>2. What is a programming language? Explain its types with merits and demerits.</h2>
    <p>A Programming Language is a formal language consisting of instructions used to produce a wide range of outputs, such as software, scripts, or algorithms.</p>
    <p><strong>Types of Programming Languages:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Low-Level Languages:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Assembly language.</li>
                <li><strong>Merits:</strong> Provides more control over hardware, faster execution.</li>
                <li><strong>Demerits:</strong> Difficult to write and understand, machine-specific.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>High-Level Languages:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Python, Java, C.</li>
                <li><strong>Merits:</strong> Easier to write, understand, and debug.</li>
                <li><strong>Demerits:</strong> Slower execution compared to low-level languages, requires a compiler or interpreter.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Middle-Level Languages:</strong>
            <ul>

    </ul>

    <!-- Compiler vs Interpreter -->
    <h2>3. Differentiate between compiler and interpreter.</h2>
    <p><strong>Compiler:</strong> A compiler translates the entire program into machine code before execution. Errors are detected after the compilation process.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> C, C++.</p>
    <p><strong>Interpreter:</strong> An interpreter translates the program line by line into machine code during execution. Errors are detected at runtime.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Python, JavaScript.</p>
    <p><strong>Difference:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Compiler produces an independent executable file, while the interpreter directly executes the source code.</li>
        <li>Compilers are faster at execution, while interpreters are slower due to line-by-line translation.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Errors -->
    <h2>4. What is an error? Briefly explain its types.</h2>

        <li><strong>Syntax Error:</strong> Occurs when the code violates the grammar rules of the programming language.</li>
        <li><strong>Runtime Error:</strong> Occurs during program execution, such as dividing by zero.</li>
        <li><strong>Logical Error:</strong> Occurs when the program runs without crashing but produces incorrect output.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Syntax vs Semantics Error -->
    <h2>5. Differentiate between syntax and semantics error.</h2>
    <p><strong>Syntax Error:</strong> A syntax error occurs when the code does not follow the grammatical rules of the programming language.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Missing parentheses in a function call.</p>
    <p><strong>Semantics Error:</strong> A semantics error occurs when the program's logic is incorrect, even though the syntax is correct.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Using the wrong formula for calculating an average.</p>

    <!-- Algorithm and Flowchart -->
    <h2>6. Define algorithm and flowchart with examples.</h2>
    <p><strong>Algorithm:</strong> An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or set of instructions to solve a problem.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> An algorithm to find the sum of two numbers:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Input the numbers.</li>
        <li>Add the numbers.</li>
        <li>Display the sum.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Flowchart:</strong> A flowchart is a diagrammatic representation of the algorithm, showing the steps using symbols like rectangles (for process), diamonds (for decision), and ovals (for start/end).</p>

    <p><strong>Difference between break and continue:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Break:</strong> The break statement is used to terminate the loop or switch statement immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Continue:</strong> The continue statement skips the current iteration of the loop and continues with the next iteration.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Looping -->
    <h2>10. What is looping? Write the difference between while and do-while loop with examples.</h2>
    <p><strong>Looping:</strong> Looping is a control structure that repeats a set of instructions multiple times.</p>
    <p><strong>Difference between while and do-while loop:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>While Loop:</strong> In a while loop, the condition is checked before the loop body is executed.</li>
        <li><strong>Do-While Loop:</strong> In a do-while loop, the loop body is executed at least once before the condition is checked.</li>
    </ul>
